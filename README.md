Godoc

Documentation Formatting
Godoc Documentation: https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc It’s a tool to view your package’s documentation “It is a great exercise to use godoc in the early phases of your package’s API design to see how your concepts will be rendered on doc. Sometimes, the visualization also has an impact on the design. Godoc is the way your users will consume a package, so it is ok to tweak things to make them more accessible. Run godoc -http=<hostport> to start a godoc server locally.” By default it runs on port 6060.
